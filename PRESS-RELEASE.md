## About
Prost is a web application designed to cater to the needs of bar owners and bar-goers, creating social environments for the consumption of alcohol while promoting both safety and local businesses. The application's features were designed with the restrictions of the covid-19 pandemic in mind, so users can have an ideal experience now and in the future.

## Why Prost?

### Safety
Prost aims to create safe drinking environments to promote both relaxing with friends and those who are yet to be called friends all while having a delicious drink. Customers can report suspicious activity in the area. 

### Pandemic
Customers can keep track of the bars they have visited, as well as contact bar owners if they have test positive for Covid-19. 

### Responsible Drinking
Owners can contact the emergency contact of customers who have had too much to drink. Our application is integrated with Uber and Lyft so customers can schedule a ride at the end of their night.

### Privacy
Privacy is a big concern here and users have complete control over whom they share their location. 

### Connections
Users can create a friends list, plan events through private messages, check their area for new spots to frequent, or curate a list of their favorite watering holes.

### Fun
Users can go solo or create parties and place themselves on our map to be seen by the public or only their friends.

### Communication
Owners can alert patrons of upcoming events and pop-ups.
