## About
**Prost:** Creating social environments for the consumption of alcohol while promoting both safety and local businesses.
### Details
Prost aims to create safe drinking environments to promote both relaxing with friends and those who are yet to be called friends all while having a delicious drink. Users can go solo or create parties and place themselves on our map to be seen by the public or only their friends.  Privacy is a big concern here and users have complete control over who they share their location with.  Users can create a friends list, plan events through private messages, check their area for new spots to frequent or curate a list of their favorite watering holes, view the varying status of any of the participating bars and restaurants including population, indoor / outdoor, masks or no masks, etc.
 
On the other hand, if you are a business owner, register with us and experience a new, fluid method of communication with your customers. Alert them to promotions, popup events, crowd numbers, and keep them up to date about the going-ons in your business.
 
Prost wants to help you find your next favorite watering hole while keeping you safe.
